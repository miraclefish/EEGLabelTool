# EEGLabelTool
**A tool to label the EEG data in an interactive way.**

The application was coded by Python (PyQt5).

You can change the source code to modify the application for other kind of multi-channel time series data labeled.
The features of this application are very simple but not well optimized.
I will gradually optimize and maintain it if necessary later.
